This code was initially tested on an Ubuntu 16.04 system using Keras 2.0.8 with Tensorflow 1.8 backend.  

Please open and follow the instruction under PeR-ViS WACVw 2021 folder. PeR-ViS Track Unpublished is the newer version considering a more complex solution by adding tracker in the framework, it also uses YOLO for better FPS in real-time. More updates will be made available after pre-print.
